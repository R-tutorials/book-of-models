Hi there, this is our book! It's about models great and small, and we hope you'll find some useful things here. Our main goal is to provide a resource for people who are learning about models for data science, and we hope that it will be useful for people who are just starting out, as well as for people who are already familiar with models but want to learn from a different perspective. Whether you're a machine learning master that would like a little bit more statistical nuance, or an academic trying to dive into the world of machine learning, we hope you'll find it helpful.

You'll definitely want to have some familiarity with R or Python, and some basic knowledge of statistics will be helpful. We'll try to explain things as we go, but we won't be able to cover everything. If you're looking for a good introduction to R, we recommend [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) or the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) for Python. Beyond that, we'll try to provide the context you need. We're not here to make you an expert, but we want you to feel comfortable with the world of models before you leave!

>This is very much a work in progress too, with more to come and plenty of things to clean up still.  If you have any feedback, we'd love to hear it. Feel free to open an issue on the repo or reach out to us directly. Thanks for reading!


<!-- TODO: Quarto bug prints this twice in ToC; tried various header tricks to no avail. Also, not unnumbered by default for krantz.cls. -->
