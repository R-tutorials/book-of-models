# book-of-models

Repo for a book tentatively titled:
- Models by Example
- Models from Scratch
- The Book of Models
- Something really cool but won't be published
- The amazing, strange and wondrous tales of a little boy named linear regression


We've seen many people struggle with understanding how models work, just as we've struggled ourselves during our own journey into data science, and as we still do whenever something new comes along.  We've also seen how much easier it is to understand models when they are presented in a way that builds on what's been learned, and in a way that is clear.  We hope this book will help remove the complexity around common approaches, show common threads and empower individuals to explore more on their own.

The book is about building models from first concepts, and adding to what's learned with additional complexities one will encounter in the wild. The goal is to build a strong foundation with relatively simpler models, showing how they can be estimated 'by hand' and with common tools. We will then build upon that knowledge to enable understanding more complex data situations. The ultimate goal is for anyone interested in understanding how models work to quickly understand the key ideas, and feel comfortable trying them on their own, or with other tools that use them.
