	abstract = {Most textbooks on regression focus on theory and the simplest of examples. Real statistical problems, however, are complex and subtle. This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is about using regression to solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction, and causal inference. Unlike other books, it focuses on practical issues such as sample size and missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques. It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use immediately. Real examples, real stories from the authors' experience demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with practical advice for understanding assumptions and implementing methods for experiments and observational studies. They make a smooth transition to logistic regression and GLM. The emphasis is on computation in R and Stan rather than derivations, with code available online. Graphics and presentation aid understanding of the models and model fitting.},

Unlike traditional books on the subject, INTRODUCTORY ECONOMETRICS� unique presentation demonstrates how econometrics has moved beyond just a set of abstract tools to become a genuinely useful tool for answering questions in business, policy evaluation, and forecasting environments. Organized around the type of data being analyzed, the book uses a systematic approach that only introduces assumptions as they are needed, which makes the material easier to understand and ultimately leads to better econometric practices. Packed with timely, relevant applications, the text emphasizes incorporates close to 100 intriguing data sets in six formats and offers updates that reflect the latest emerging developments in the field.},

In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.},
