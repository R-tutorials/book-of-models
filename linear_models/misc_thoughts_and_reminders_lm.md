misc thoughts and reminders


# topics to touch on in some fashion

- uncertain excursions (talking about uncertainty)

- cross validation and related
    - 
# Interludes

- Practical modeling vs. idealistic (academic) modeling
- garden of forking generalized models
- Data  Issues 
    - missing data
        - recommend assessment of predicted data similarity to observed data
    - data quality and reliability/measurement
    - Sparsity
    - Outliers
    - Imbalanced data
    - 'Big' Data, Scalability
    - Data types
        - Categorical
        - Ordinal
        - Continuous
        - Time series
        - Text
        - Images
        - Audio
        - Video
        - Geospatial
        - etc.
    - Feature Engineering/Pre-processing/Categorical Embeddings/Dimensionality Reduction/Feature Selection/Feature Extraction
    - misc feature types: ordinal, zero-infated, etc.
    - Transformations: std, log, max
    - Data leakage
    - Data drift
    - Data bias (lack of representativeness), vs. statistical bias
    - Misc:
        - Data privacy, security, ethics
        - Data provenance, governance
- Causality
    - Causal inference
    - Techniques: experimental design, matching, meta-learners, uplift modeling, etc.
- Model interpretability
    - Feature importance
    - Model explainability
    - Model transparency (e.g. model cards)
    - Model debugging
    - Model fairness: models are ideas, ideas may not be correct, may be ill-posed, or generally off-base, and even wrong by most standards.  The data may be inaccurate, or not representative. None of this is the model's fault.
- Uncertainty
    - Bayesian inference
    - Bootstrap
    - Conformal Predictions

- Misc Models
    - Graphical/Network models
    - Survival models, censoring
    - MMM
    - Mixture models/Clustering
    - zero-infated/altered/adjusted
    - Time series models
    - Reinforcement learning
    - Ensemble models
    - Regression vs. Classification

- Inference vs./is not Prediction (somewhere along the way these ideas were conflated).  Prediction could be said to be a form of inference, but not all inference is prediction.  Inference does not require a data-driven model, nor even the direction of generalization implied by such models. In the modeling sense, inference strongly suggests a causal framework.  We can make inference mean whatever we want in the modeling context- causal modeling, understanding the data generating process, prediction, or whatever, but doing so doesn't add clarity because of its long-standing usage outside of the modeling context (which also applies to modeling in a general way).
