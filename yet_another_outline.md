Intro

# LM
- Core ideas
- Prediction
- Basic Interpretation
- Adding Complexity
- Assumptions of a linear (and other) model(s)

Question- how to fit classification here without spilling into other stuff?

## Model Criticism

- General fit
- Model Comparison
- Model Selection
- Model debugging

Misc:

- Model transparency (e.g. model cards)
- Model fairness 

## Model Estimation

- OLS, MLE
- Classification
- Penalized
- Optimization, SGD
- Bayesian

## LM Extensions

- GLM, GAM, Mixed Models
- Optim/Linear Programming/Hungarian Algorithm?
- Latent Linear Models
- Mixture models/Clustering


# Machine learning

- CV, metrics
- Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net
- Trees
    - RF
    - GBM
- DL 
    - NN
    - Autoencoders
- Reinforcement learning
- Ensemble models


## Uncertainty
- Bayesian inference
- Bootstrap
- Conformal Predictions



## Data Stuff

- Feature and Target Transformations
- missing data
    - recommend assessment of predicted data similarity to observed data
- data quality and reliability/measurement
- Sparsity
- Outliers
- Imbalanced data
- 'Big' Data, Scalability
- Data types
    - Categorical
    - Ordinal
    - Continuous
    - Time series
    - Text
    - Images
    - Audio
    - Video
    - Geospatial
    - etc.
- Feature Engineering/Pre-processing/Categorical Embeddings/Dimensionality Reduction/Feature Selection/Feature Extraction
- misc feature types: ordinal, zero-infated, etc.
- Transformations: std, log, max
- Data leakage
- Data drift
- Data bias (lack of representativeness), vs. statistical bias
- Misc:
    - Data privacy, security, ethics
    - Data provenance, governance

# Other Stuff

- Causality
    - Causal inference
    - Techniques: experimental design, matching, meta-learners, uplift modeling, etc.
