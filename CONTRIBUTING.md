# Contributing to book-of-models

This outlines how to propose a change to book-of-models. Basically, you can treat this similar to other R/Python packages.

## Fixing typos

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors by just forking and making a PR that clearly describes the proposed changes. 

## Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, e.g. code or something more dramatic, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure the authors agree that it's needed.  If/when you create a PR with the changes, they should reference the issue number (e.g. `#123`) so that they will be automatically linked together.


### Pull request process

*   Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven't done this before, then we recommend you just create an issue for the authors to deal with it. 

### Allowed changes

Only changes to qmd files will be accepted unless otherwise agreed upon in an issue/discussion.
